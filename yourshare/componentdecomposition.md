Why?

3 components:

1. Brand component

  * Name of the app
  * Logo of the app
  * Not reused
  
2. SignUp component

  * Text: Join your community
  * Text: Signup 
  * 3 input boxes: Username, phone number, zip code
  * Button: Join

  * This could be reused anywhere in the app where I want to have sign up
  
3. SignIn component
