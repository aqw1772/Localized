## SignUp page - Christelle

Why?

3 components:

### Brand component

  * Not reused
  
### SignUp component

  * Text: Join your community
  * Text: Signup 
  * 3 input boxes: Username, phone number, zip code
  * Button: Join

  * This could be reused anywhere in the app where I want to have sign up
  
### SignIn component
